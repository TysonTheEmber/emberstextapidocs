# ðŸ“· Aperture API

Aperture API is a cinematic camera toolkit for **Forge 1.20.1** that ships with an **inâ€‘game editor**, **Bezier handles/gizmos**, and a **command surface** to script shots. Use it to create smooth, repeatable camera motions for trailers, machinima, or cutscenes.

> - Multiple interpolation modes (Bezier, Catmullâ€‘Rom, Cosine, Linear, Step)
> - Utilities for **constantâ€‘speed** playback and clean easing
> - Minimal commands to play, stop, list, and export paths
> - Clean, integrationâ€‘ready API surface
